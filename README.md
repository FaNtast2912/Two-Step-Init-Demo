# Swift Two-Phase Initialization Explained üß†

Understanding **two-phase initialization** in Swift is crucial for writing safe and predictable code ‚Äî especially when working with inheritance.

This repository demonstrates how Swift ensures that all stored properties are initialized before the object becomes usable. The example shows a simple class hierarchy (`Vehicle` ‚Üí `Car`) to illustrate the exact order of execution during initialization.

---

## üîç What‚Äôs Inside?

### Classes:
- `Vehicle`: Base class with a single property `model`
- `Car`: Subclass with an additional property `seats`, demonstrating both designated and convenience initializers

The project includes print statements that clearly show:
- When each phase of initialization begins
- How properties are initialized step-by-step
- Why and when you can/cannot access `self` or inherited properties

## üß™ Try it yourself!

Just run the playground or the main file ‚Äî see how the logs unfold and verify your understanding of:

- Initializer delegation
- Property initialization order
- Safety checks enforced by Swift (SC1‚ÄìSC4)

## ‚úÖ Swift Safety Checks Covered

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| SC1 | All properties must be initialized before delegating up |
| SC2 | Cannot use inherited properties until after `super.init()` |
| SC3 | Convenience initializers must delegate before touching any properties |
| SC4 | No use of `self` until Phase 1 completes |
